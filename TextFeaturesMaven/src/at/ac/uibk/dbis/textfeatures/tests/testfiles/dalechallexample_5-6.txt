Eskimos of Alaska’s Arctic north coast have
hunted whales for centuries. 
Survival has depended on killing the 80-footlong
bowhead whales that swim from the
Bering Sea to the ice-clogged Beaufort Sea
each Spring. The Eskimos’ entire way of life
has been centered around the hunt. 
But now that way of life is being threatened
by America’s need for oil, say many Eskimos
who hunt the whales.
